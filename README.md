## Notes on mindustry mod building on a Mac

Open a terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/{your account}/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Mindustry/Mindustry.app/Contents/Resources/saves/mods
```

In here create a dir:
`mkdir moving-on-up`

Extract / move all /src into this directory, PLUS preview.png

Inside mindustry, go to mods, then press the little arrow icon - this enables you to publish to Steam workshop inside the game.
